# Dimad

DIMAD is a program which studies particle behavior in circular machines and in beamlines. The trajectories of the particles are computed according to the second order matrix formalism.

DIMAD does not provide synchrotron motion analysis but can simulate it. The program provides the user with the possibility of defining arbitrary elements to tailor the program to specific uses.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/dimad-org/dimad/).
